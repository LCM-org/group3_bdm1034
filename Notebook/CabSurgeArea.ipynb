    "- sys is module that provides access to system-specific parameters and functions.\n",
    "- io is a module that provides access to use the methods/types in the io module\n",
    "- train_test_split is used to split a dataset into training and testing sets for machine learning\n",
    "- LinearRegression is used to implement linear regression algorithm for regression tasks\n",
    "- matplotlib.pyplot is used for the creation of visualization\n",
    "- confusion_matrix is used to generate confusion matrix which shows data that falls under True Positive, False Positive, True Negative and False Negative\n",
    "- mean_squared_error is used to calculate the mean_squared error of the regression model. The mean squared error represents the average squared residual. As the data points fall closer to the regression line, the model has less error, decreasing the MSE.\n",
